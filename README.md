# ProjectDawn
- ProjectDawn v0.0.1 Updated to UE5
- This is Project dawn build v0.0.1 
You need dependencies to make this package work.
1 . I have removed most of the Megascans assets I used. You can replace the assets in the blueprints.
2 . I would need a VRM4U plugin to make the Vroid characters work. 
3 . Some NPC Textures were not updated in the current build especially the animal pack you might need to redownload those assets.
4 . In addition the following asset packs are not included.
    a . Infinity blade/fx/bladeEffects/Assets/warriors
    b . Animal variety pack
    c . European Beech/Hornbeam
    d . LowPoly Viking World
    e . Project Nature Grass Library/ Foliage collection/ Fern/ Open World Foilage
    f . Weapon Pack
    g . Stylized Winter City

    These are the assets I have used Feel free to use any alternatives
5 . I havent Included all the sounds either replace where necessary.
6 . Phys material needs to be rebuilt. Footstep sounds are generated using Phys material.
7 . rVT is disabled by default you might need to go into the Master material to change that.

Thank you.

Sid.
